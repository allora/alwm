# Allie's Lazy WM

ALWM is my attempt at learning Rust through a toy window manager. This project is many firsts for me. My first xlib project, my first WM, and one of my first Rust projects. As I find time and learn more, new features will be added.

Current Features:
* Exit funcitonality through the default key binding Super+Shift+F1
* Window borders! (Hardcoded atm)
* Window Focus
* Window Movement
* Window Resize

Work In Progress:
